Ratpack Tutorial
-----------------------------
This project uses ```git tag``` to identify the examples used in the presentation(which is
contained within this project).
Each tag represents the different states that I felt a newcomer to Ratpack would
like to see example code of.

The tags and git command to checkout the code(after you clone the project)
are:

``` git checkout Lazy_Bones```

``` git checkout no_frills_site```

``` git checkout API_Handlebars_ContentAware```

``` git checkout BasicAuth_Example```

``` git checkout Github_OAuth_Example```

``` git checkout Asset_Pipeline_OAuth_Update```

``` git checkout Dropwizard_Metrics```


 You can start the basic app with

```
    ./gradlew run
```
Read the commit logs in addition to the code comments for further insight.
